New API features in Gemini 3
Gemini 3 introduces new parameters designed to give developers more control over latency, cost, and multimodal fidelity.

Thinking level
Gemini 3 series models use dynamic thinking by default to reason through prompts. You can use the thinking_level parameter, which controls the maximum depth of the model's internal reasoning process before it produces a response. Gemini 3 treats these levels as relative allowances for thinking rather than strict token guarantees.

If thinking_level is not specified, Gemini 3 will default to high. For faster, lower-latency responses when complex reasoning isn't required, you can constrain the model's thinking level to low.

Gemini 3 Pro and Flash thinking levels:

The following thinking levels are supported by both Gemini 3 Pro and Flash:

low: Minimizes latency and cost. Best for simple instruction following, chat, or high-throughput applications
high (Default, dynamic): Maximizes reasoning depth. The model may take significantly longer to reach a first token, but the output will be more carefully reasoned.
Gemini 3 Flash thinking levels

In addition to the levels above, Gemini 3 Flash also supports the following thinking levels that are not currently supported by Gemini 3 Pro:

minimal: Matches the “no thinking” setting for most queries. The model may think very minimally for complex coding tasks. Minimizes latency for chat or high throughput applications.

Note: Circulation of thought signatures is required even when thinking level is set to minimal for Gemini 3 Flash.
medium: Balanced thinking for most tasks.

Python
JavaScript
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-pro-preview",
    contents="How does AI work?",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_level="low")
    ),
)

print(response.text)
Important: You cannot use both thinking_level and the legacy thinking_budget parameter in the same request. Doing so will return a 400 error.
Media resolution
Gemini 3 introduces granular control over multimodal vision processing via the media_resolution parameter. Higher resolutions improve the model's ability to read fine text or identify small details, but increase token usage and latency. The media_resolution parameter determines the maximum number of tokens allocated per input image or video frame.

You can now set the resolution to media_resolution_low, media_resolution_medium, media_resolution_high, or media_resolution_ultra_high per individual media part or globally (via generation_config, global not available for ultra high). If unspecified, the model uses optimal defaults based on the media type.

Recommended settings

Media Type	Recommended Setting	Max Tokens	Usage Guidance
Images	media_resolution_high	1120	Recommended for most image analysis tasks to ensure maximum quality.
PDFs	media_resolution_medium	560	Optimal for document understanding; quality typically saturates at medium. Increasing to high rarely improves OCR results for standard documents.
Video (General)	media_resolution_low (or media_resolution_medium)	70 (per frame)	Note: For video, low and medium settings are treated identically (70 tokens) to optimize context usage. This is sufficient for most action recognition and description tasks.
Video (Text-heavy)	media_resolution_high	280 (per frame)	Required only when the use case involves reading dense text (OCR) or small details within video frames.
Note: The media_resolution parameter maps to different token counts depending on the input type. While images scale linearly (media_resolution_low: 280, media_resolution_medium: 560, media_resolution_high: 1120), Video is compressed more aggressively. For Video, both media_resolution_low and media_resolution_medium are capped at 70 tokens per frame, and media_resolution_high is capped at 280 tokens. See full details here

                )
            ]
        )
    ]
)

print(response.text)
Temperature
For Gemini 3, we strongly recommend keeping the temperature parameter at its default value of 1.0.

While previous models often benefited from tuning temperature to control creativity versus determinism, Gemini 3's reasoning capabilities are optimized for the default setting. Changing the temperature (setting it below 1.0) may lead to unexpected behavior, such as looping or degraded performance, particularly in complex mathematical or reasoning tasks.

Thought signatures
Gemini 3 uses Thought signatures to maintain reasoning context across API calls. These signatures are encrypted representations of the model's internal thought process. To ensure the model maintains its reasoning capabilities you must return these signatures back to the model in your request exactly as they were received:

Function Calling (Strict): The API enforces strict validation on the "Current Turn". Missing signatures will result in a 400 error.

Note: Circulation of thought signatures is required even when thinking level is set to minimal for Gemini 3 Flash.
Text/Chat: Validation is not strictly enforced, but omitting signatures will degrade the model's reasoning and answer quality.

Image generation/editing (Strict): The API enforces strict validation on all Model parts including a thoughtSignature. Missing signatures will result in a 400 error.

Success: If you use the official SDKs (Python, Node, Java) and standard chat history, Thought Signatures are handled automatically. You do not need to manually manage these fields.
Function calling (strict validation)
When Gemini generates a functionCall, it relies on the thoughtSignature to process the tool's output correctly in the next turn. The "Current Turn" includes all Model (functionCall) and User (functionResponse) steps that occurred since the last standard User text message.

Single Function Call: The functionCall part contains a signature. You must return it.
Parallel Function Calls: Only the first functionCall part in the list will contain the signature. You must return the parts in the exact order received.
Multi-Step (Sequential): If the model calls a tool, receives a result, and calls another tool (within the same turn), both function calls have signatures. You must return all accumulated signatures in the history.
Text and streaming
For standard chat or text generation, the presence of a signature is not guaranteed.

Non-Streaming: The final content part of the response may contain a thoughtSignature, though it is not always present. If one is returned, you should send it back to maintain best performance.
Streaming: If a signature is generated, it may arrive in a final chunk that contains an empty text part. Ensure your stream parser checks for signatures even if the text field is empty.
Image generation and editing
For gemini-3-pro-image-preview, thought signatures are critical for conversational editing. When you ask the model to modify an image it relies on the thoughtSignature from the previous turn to understand the composition and logic of the original image.

Editing: Signatures are guaranteed on the first part after the thoughts of the response (text or inlineData) and on every subsequent inlineData part. You must return all of these signatures to avoid errors.

Migrating from other models
If you are transferring a conversation trace from another model (e.g., Gemini 2.5) or injecting a custom function call that was not generated by Gemini 3, you will not have a valid signature.

To bypass strict validation in these specific scenarios, populate the field with this specific dummy string: "thoughtSignature": "context_engineering_is_the_way_to_go"

Structured Outputs with tools
Gemini 3 models allow you to combine Structured Outputs with built-in tools, including Grounding with Google Search, URL Context, and Code Execution.

JavaScript
REST

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class MatchResult(BaseModel):
    winner: str = Field(description="The name of the winner.")
    final_match_score: str = Field(description="The final match score.")
    scorers: List[str] = Field(description="The name of the scorer.")

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-pro-preview",
    contents="Search for all details for the latest Euro.",
    config={
        "tools": [
            {"google_search": {}},
            {"url_context": {}}
        ],
        "response_mime_type": "application/json",
        "response_json_schema": MatchResult.model_json_schema(),
    },  
)

result = MatchResult.model_validate_json(response.text)
print(result)
Image generation
Gemini 3 Pro Image lets you generate and edit images from text prompts. It uses reasoning to "think" through a prompt and can retrieve real-time data—such as weather forecasts or stock charts—before using Google Search grounding before generating high-fidelity images.

New & improved capabilities:

4K & text rendering: Generate sharp, legible text and diagrams with up to 2K and 4K resolutions.
Grounded generation: Use the google_search tool to verify facts and generate imagery based on real-world information.
Conversational editing: Multi-turn image
